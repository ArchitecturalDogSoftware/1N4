# 1N4

> Your resident M41D Unit, here to help with your server.

1N4, pronounced 'ee-nah' (/inä/),
is a Discord bot made for a private Minecraft SMP.

It provides moderation capabilities and various useful features,
while also including built-in lore through the official bot.
None of the bot's lore will be provided through this repository for the sake of secrecy.
Spoilers are no fun!

1N4 probably isn't for you, as it is highly specialized for what our server needs as a group.

## Usage

You may invite 1N4 using her [invitation link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1265640027896021106),
or you can install and run her directly through Git and Cargo.

```sh
# Clone and move into the repository.
git clone 'https://github.com/ArchitecturalDogSoftware/1N4.git'
cd 1N4

# Build in release mode.
cargo build --release

# Relocate the binary and clean up build artifacts.
mv ./target/release/ina .
cargo clean

./ina --help
```

If you are running your own instance of 1N4, ensure that the following environment variables are set to get full functionality:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - The bot's Discord token,
  which is required to connect to their API.
  This can be generated by [creating a new application](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUILD_ID` - The bot's 'development guild',
  which is where the bot will accept interactions from when not running in release mode.
- `DEVELOPMENT_CHANNEL_ID` - The bot's 'development channel',
  which is where things like error logs are sent.
  1N4 assumes that the given channel is within the guild specified by `DEVELOPMENT_GUILD_ID`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - The password used for encrypting and decrypting sensitive files.

### Docker

Alternatively, 1N4 is available through a Docker container running Alpine Linux.

```sh
# Build for the host platform.
docker buildx build --tag 'ArchitecturalDogSoftware/ina' .

# Or build for another target.
#
# Compiles for the target triple `$TARGET_ARCH_RUST-unknown-linux-musl`.
docker buildx build --tag 'ArchitecturalDogSoftware/ina' \
    --platform 'arm64' --build-arg 'TARGET_ARCH_RUST=aarch64' \
    .

# Start the Docker container and attach the TTY.
#
# Instead of `--env-file`, you could manually set each of the required
# environment variables using `--env VAR=value`.
#
# 1N4 loads various resources at runtime, by default from `./res/`. Mount this
# directory with `--mount 'type=bind,source=./res,target=/app/res,readonly'`.
docker run --tty \
    --env-file '.env' \
    'ArchitecturalDogSoftware/ina'
```

If a different target CPU architecture is chosen,
Rust will cross-compile for that architecture from a native image.
The last build step that puts the image together still relies on emulating the target architecture, however.
[Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#qemu) points towards [`tonistiigi/binfmt`](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt)
as being the easy option to set up QEMU for this,
but your package manager may provide its own packages if you prefer that.
For example, one can set up emulation on Ubuntu 24.04 (and probably other Debian derivatives) like so:

```sh
apt install 'binfmt-support' 'qemu-user-static'

qemu_ref='master' # Or set to a specific version, e.g., `v8.2.2`.
curl --fail --show-error --location --remote-name \
    "https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/$qemu_ref/scripts/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh"
chmod u+x './qemu-binfmt-conf.sh'

# `--systemd 'ALL'` registers every interpreter at startup with a systemd
# service. Without this flag, you'll have to re-run this script every time you
# restart. You can also specify individual CPU architectures to register, `ALL`
# registers every architecture supported by QEMU.
#
# `./qemu-binfmt-conf.sh --help` for more information.
./qemu-binfmt-conf.sh --qemu-suffix '-static' --qemu-path '/usr/bin' \
    --persistent 'yes' \
    --systemd 'ALL'
```

## Governance

1N4 is primarily authored by Jaxydog,
but as an ArchitecturalDog Software project,
RemasteredArch is a maintainer as well.
Jaxydog is also the operator of 1N4's primary instance.
You can get in touch with us by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/ArchitecturalDogSoftware/1N4/issues) (our preference)
or sending us an email at <ArchitecturalDogSoftware@gmail.com>.

1N4 does not currently have any formal community governance.
However, we are still open to suggestions ---
[contributions](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome,
whether that is code, documentation, ideas, or anything else that makes a project shine!
